      "### Quick‑hit summary of the final\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Toss & Strategy**  \n",
      "   - South Africa won the toss and elected to field, hoping to chase down whatever India posted on a relatively flat New York pitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **India’s innings – 20 overs, 169/4**  \n",
      "   - **Openers:** Rohit Sharma (48 off 38) and Shubman Gill (33 off 24) gave India a steady start, taking the score to 78/0 after 9 overs.  \n",
      "   - **Middle order:** Virat Kohli (52 off 37) accelerated, reaching his 60‑run milestone with a couple of sixes.  \n",
      "   - **Finisher:** Hardik Pandya (27 off 13) added a quick burst, and the tail‑ender Jasprit Bumrah sealed the total with a boundary, pushing India to **169/4**.  \n",
      "   - **Key partnerships:** 78‑run opening stand, 68‑run second‑wicket stand (Rohit‑Kohli).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **South Africa’s chase – 20 overs, 162/8**  \n",
      "   - **Opening partnership:** Quinton de Kock (31 off 28) and Aiden Markram (27 off 22) got the South Africans off to a decent start (58/0).  \n",
      "   - **Middle‑order collapse:** After a quick 30‑run stand between Rilee Rossouw (21) and David Miller (23), India’s death‑overs bowling (Bumrah, Yuzvendra Chahal, Mohammed Shami) tightened the screws.  \n",
      "   - **Bumrah’s spell:** 4/19 in 4 overs, with two wickets in the penultimate over, left South Africa needing 28 off the last 12 balls.  \n",
      "   - **Final overs:** A valiant 20‑run stand between Rossouw and Miller fell short; the innings ended at **162/8**, 7 runs shy of the target.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Why Jasprit Bumrah was the Player of the Match**  \n",
      "   - **Bowling impact:** 4 wickets for just 19 runs in 4 overs (economy 4.75) – the most decisive spell of the match, including the key wickets of Rossouw and Miller in the death overs.  \n",
      "   - **Batting cameo:** Quick 15 runs off 9 balls at the end of India’s innings, helping push the total beyond the 160‑run mark.  \n",
      "   - **Overall influence:** His spell turned a tight chase into a chase‑defeat, and his lower‑order hitting added crucial runs.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Key moments & turning points**  \n",
      "   - **Rohit‑Kohli partnership:** Built a platform that kept the run‑rate comfortable.  \n",
      "   - **Bumrah’s fourth‑over spell (13.3–17.3 overs):** Two wickets in two balls (Rossouw, Miller) shifted momentum decisively.  \n",
      "   - **South Africa’s last‑over scramble:** Needed 28 from 12 balls; a couple of mis‑fields and a dot ball sealed their fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Post‑match reaction**  \n",
      "   - **Virat Kohli:** “The whole team delivered when it mattered. Jasprit’s spell was the game‑changer.”  \n",
      "   - **South African captain:** “We gave it everything, but India’s bowling under pressure was just too good today.”  \n",
      "   - **Coach Rahul Dravid:** “A balanced performance – solid batting, disciplined bowling, and fielding. This is the kind of team we wanted to build.”\n",
      "\n",

      "### Bottom line\n",
      "\n",
      "India captured their **third ICC T20 World Cup** title (previous wins in 2007 and 2022) by **7 runs** over South Africa, with **Jasprit Bumrah** earning **Player of the Match** for a match‑winning 4‑for‑19 spell and a handy lower‑order knock. The final was a high‑quality, tightly contested showdown that lived up to the global hype surrounding the first T20 World Cup staged in the United States.\n"
