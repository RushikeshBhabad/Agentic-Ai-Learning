      "   * Openers Quinton de Kock (31) and Aiden Markram (38) gave a solid start.  \n",
      "   * After a quick 70‑run partnership, de Kock was dismissed, and South Africa slumped to 100/5.  \n",
      "   * A late surge from David Miller (33*) and a quick cameo by Kieron Pollard (18 off 9) took the total to **176/7** in the full 20 overs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **India’s chase**  \n",
      "   * Openers Ruturaj Gaikwad (73 off 44) and Shubman Gill (31 off 20) gave India a flying start, reaching 100/0 in just 7.2 overs.  \n",
      "   * Gaikwad was run‑out for 73, but Virat Kohli (44 off 31) and Hardik Pandya (12 off 7) kept the momentum.  \n",
      "   * A calm finish by Rahul Tripathi (13* off 9) saw India finish on **176/3** in 19.5 overs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Why Jasprit Bumrah earned Player of the Match**  \n",
      "   * Bumrah’s 4‑over spell (3/19) dismantled South Africa’s middle order, taking key wickets of Miller, Pollard and Van der Merwe.  \n",
      "   * His economical spell (economy 4.75) set the tone for the chase and was decisive in restricting the hosts to a sub‑180 total.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Key moments & turning points**  \n",
      "   * Gaikwad’s blistering 73 off 44 gave India a huge platform; his strike‑rate of 166 made the chase look comfortable early on.  \n",
      "   * Bumrah’s early breakthrough (2/9 in the first 4 overs) kept South Africa under pressure and prevented any big partnership.  \n",
      "   * The final wicket fell with 5 balls remaining, sealing India’s **first ever T20 World Cup title**.\n",
