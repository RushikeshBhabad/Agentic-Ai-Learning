      "|---------|-------|-------------|\n",
      "| **India (batting first)** | **176/7 (20 overs)** | • Rohit Sharma gave a quick start (31 off 20).<br>• Virat Kohli took charge at 86/2, smashing 76 off 49 with 8 fours and 3 sixes, anchoring the chase.<br>• Hardik Pandya added a handy 38* off 22 to push the total past the 170 mark.<br>• Jasprit Bumrah bowled the death overs, finishing with 2/28. |\n",
      "| **South Africa (chasing)** | **169/8 (20 overs)** | • Quinton de Kock’s brisk 44 set a good platform.<br>• Aamer Salah (55) tried to keep them in, but the required run‑rate climbed sharply after the 12th over.<br>• India’s spin trio (Ravindra Jadeja, Yuzvendra Chahal, and Axar Patel) applied relentless pressure, each taking a wicket and keeping the run‑rate low.<br>• In the final over, South Africa needed 12 from 6 balls; Bumrah bowled a perfect death over, conceding just 5 runs and taking a wicket (David Miller) to seal the win. |\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why It Was a Classic\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Virat Kohli’s Masterclass** – The 76‑run knock was Kohli’s highest T20 World Cup score and came under pressure, steering India away from a precarious 86/2 position. His innings earned him the **Player of the Match** award and cemented his reputation as a big‑stage performer.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Tight Bowling Duel** – Both sides had world‑class death‑over specialists. India’s bowlers (especially Bumrah and the spin unit) kept South Africa’s scoring in check, while South Africa’s pace attack (Lungi Ngidi, Kagiso Rabada) struggled to break the key partnerships early on.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Historic Setting** – The final was the first ICC World Cup final ever hosted on U.S. soil, drawing a crowd of over 30,000 and showcasing cricket’s growing footprint in North America.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Strategic Decisions** – India’s captain **Rohit Sharma** chose to bat first after winning the toss, trusting the depth of their batting line‑up and the potency of their death‑overs. The decision paid off as the 176 total proved just enough on a modestly batting‑friendly pitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Nail‑Biting Finish** – The match went down to the final over. With 12 required off 6 balls, South Africa needed a boundary and a couple of singles. Bumrah’s disciplined line, variation, and a crucial wicket turned the tide, sealing the 7‑run victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "India clinched their **second ICC T20 World Cup title** (their first since 2022) by out‑scoring South Africa by a narrow 7‑run margin. The win was anchored by a spectacular **Virat Kohli** innings (76 off 49) that earned him the **Player of the Match** award. The final, staged at New Jersey’s Red Bull Arena, highlighted the growing global reach of cricket, delivered a thrilling chase‑versus‑defence narrative, and cemented India’s status as the premier T20 nation of the era.\n"
